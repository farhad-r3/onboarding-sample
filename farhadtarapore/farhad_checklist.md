# Welcome to R3, Farhad!

_"You never get a second chance to make a first impression."_

## R3 Operating Principles: 
* We organize around our customers 
* We take intelligent risks and​ do not fear failure 
* We celebrate success and​ embrace all feedback 
* We hold each other accountable​ 

**Welcome Farhad**

As you start your new role here at R3, we’ve pulled some useful information together as part of your on-boarding with us. 

Below you’ll find information relating to your Buddy and some key contacts within the business for you.  You will already have received your “Welcome to R3” e-mail from the People team with some useful information and how to access tools and systems. 

## A Buddy

We thought it was important we have you connect with someone, and we have therefore arranged for you to be partnered with a Buddy during your first few weeks here.  Their contact details are below. 

We know how busy everyone is, but on-boarding new people into R3 is key to any new hire’s success.  We all know how daunting it can be to join a new workplace. No matter how many induction sessions and welcome meetings the company puts into place, there’s still the little stressful things like who to have lunch with/where to get the best coffee from/who to ask the seemingly silly questions to (like “why are we called R3 anyway?”). 

**What do Buddies Do?**

* Explain all the things that make R3 unique 
* Add you to the relevant team-specific calendar invites, Slack and Teams channels  
* They are someone to have lunch/coffee breaks within the first few weeks when you are getting to know everyone 
* Offer advice about where to find things and who to ask about what 
* Give you an overview of who’s who and make sure to introduce you to everyone in the team 
* Are there to listen to any feedback about the company in general

## Key Contacts to setup 1-1s with
Listed below are some key people you should spend some time with (in person or arrange a call or webinar), during your first few weeks.  I suggest you work through the Directory to send out some introduction requests.  Everyone here is very friendly and professional – but busy and often traveling, so don’t worry if you have to reschedule a couple of meetings!
